This hackathon project is an extension of the Polyglot app, part of the PolyPhy toolkit of network-inspired data science tools (for background on the PolyPhy hub, see [here](https://github.com/PolyPhyHub)). We modify the original app to display a point cloud of bird songs data (with audio playback available!).

# Background and Methodology

# Features
1. Press <kbd>Control</kbd> to hold the tooltip in place (ie., so we can hit the audio play button). Hit <kbd>Control</kbd> again to go back to hovering. If it does not go away, try clicking outside of the tooltip and pressing <kbd>Control</kbd> again.

2. Press and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to see only the anchor points

3. Double click any anchor point (yellow point) to change the anchor (you will see the rest of the point cloud change color).
   
4. Fuzzy-text search bar and ‚Äújump to point‚Äù feature for smoother navigation

*Search feature. The point we have jumped to is highlighted in green.*

5. A grayscale mode

This version of Polyglot was extended as part of Kiran Deol's 2023 Google Summer of Code project, mentored by [Oskar Elek](http://elek.pub) and [Jasmine Otto](https://jazztap.github.io) and is hosted as part of PolyPhy hub of bio-inspired data science tools.

This web visualization tool was originally created by a team of researchers at University of California, Santa Cruz, Dept. of Computational Media:
